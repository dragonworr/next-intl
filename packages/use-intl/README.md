# use-intl üåê

![Gzipped size](https://badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/use-intl) ![Tree shaking supported](https://badgen.net/bundlephobia/tree-shaking/use-intl) ![Build passing](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/amannn/next-intl/main)

A minimal, but complete solution for managing translations, date, time and number formatting in React apps.

## Features

- üåü I18n is an essential part of the user experience, therefore this library doesn't compromise on flexibility and never leaves you behind when you need to fine tune a translation. Messages use the **proven [ICU syntax](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax)** which covers interpolation, numbers, dates, times, plurals, ordinal pluralization, label selection based on enums and rich text.
- üìÖ Built-in **date, time and number formatting** provides all the necessary parts you need for localisation. You can use global formats for a consistent look & feel of your app and integrate them with translations.
- üí° A **hooks-only API** ensures that you can use the same API for `children` as well as for attributes which expect strings.
- ‚öîÔ∏è Based on **battle-tested** building blocks from [Format.JS](https://formatjs.io/) (used by `react-intl`), this library is a thin wrapper around high-quality, lower-level APIs for i18n.

## What does it look like?

This library is based on the premise that messages can be grouped by namespaces (typically a component name).

```js
// en.json
{
  "LatestFollower": {
    "latestFollower": "<user>{username}</user> started following you {followDateRelative} ({followDate, date, short})",
    "followBack": "Follow back"
  }
}
```

```jsx
// LatestFollower.js
function LatestFollower({event}) {
  const t = useTranslations('LatestFollower');
  const intl = useIntl();

  return (
    <>
      <Text>
        {t('latestFollower', {
          user: children => <b>{children}</b>,
          username: event.user.name,
          followDateRelative: intl.formatRelativeTime(event.followDate),
          followDate: event.followDate
        })}
      </Text>
      <IconButton aria-label={t('followBack')} icon={<FollowIcon />} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```jsx
// Output
<p><b>Jane</b> started following you two weeks ago (Feb 4, 2021)</p>
<button aria-label="Follow back"><svg ... /></button>
```

## Installation

1. Install `use-intl` in your project
2. Add the provider
```jsx
import {IntlProvider} from 'use-intl';

// You can get the messages from anywhere you like. You can also fetch
// them from within a component and then render the provider along with
// your app once you have the messages.
const messages = {
  App: {
    hello: 'Hello'
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <IntlProvider messages={messages} locale="en">
    <App />
  </IntlProvider>
)
```
3. Based on the features you need and the browsers you support, you might have to provide [polyfills](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills).
4. Use translations in your components!
